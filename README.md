# BonziWORLD Revived

This project was discontinued in October 2020, it's 1st anniversary of being a server. The source code is available here.

If you are a member on The Microsoft Agent Frontier Empire then you most likely would recognize this.

The only known websites that are hosting this Fork are tmafe.com (konnor88, offline) and bonkeyword.tk (ius)

All the source code for the server and client is publically available here. If you want to run your own BonziWORLD, by all means go ahead. Do whatever you'd like with this code. Just try to put me somewhere in the credits.

## Dependencies
- Node.js and npm
- Ruby
- Sass
- Git
- Cordova (Optional)

## Setup
In a terminal/command prompt, navigate to where you'd like BonziWORLD to be placed and run the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/Seamusmario/BonziWORLD-Revived
cd BonziWORLD
```

### Client
This part is unneeded. An pre-built version is available.

### Server
```
cd bwr-server
npm install
node index.js
```
After this, BonziWORLD will be accessible on port 3000. (http://localhost:3000/)
